# Content_Detection_and_Classification_Of_Youtube_Videos
•Developed a deep learning–based system to detect inappropriate content in YouTube videos, achieving ~87% classification accuracyacross multiple categories (safe, offensive, violent, adult).
•Implemented LSTM and CNN models, improving precision and recall by ~20% compared to baseline classifiers.
•Handled imbalanced data with sampling techniques, boosting minority class detection accuracy by ~15%.
•Built a Django-based web interface for video review and moderation, enabling real-time classification and management
